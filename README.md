# Music Group Member Line Distribution

This is a personal project based on many K-pop line distribution videos on youtube which shows how much each member of a group is singing.

## How to Launch the Application

Download project and open www/index.html.

## How to Use the Application

1. Choose one of the presets, by clicking the **Sets button** in the main menu OR create your own set.

_A Custom Set is temporary and disappears as soon as you close or refresh the application._

2. Play the song you want on your favorite music app.
3. Click and hold the boxes as long as that particular singer is singing.
4. When you release the box, the progress bar will display how much that singer has sung, as well, how long he has sung, in seconds, in that box.
5. When you are done, click the **Finish button (check mark symbol)** to display a window with the results in order and with final percentages.

## Other controls
